The sighting caused alarm, however, the video actually shows something rather outlandish happening that one wouldn\'t expect to be covered by local news media reports in Colorado matching the description of the sighting.\n\n\n\nAlthough the Southern Colorado region, known as the San Luis Valley, is an apparent hotspot for UFO sightings, the video didn\'t originate in Colorado. It was initially reported in March', ""2017 by people claiming to have seen an alien craft somewhere in the Sonora region of the Mexican state that touches the United States border. Humans have not known contact with extraterrestrials, however, we aren't sure whether the video is computer generated or the result of a light trick. tabloid media reports in Mexico claimed that residents saw the object and were frightened, but didn't quote any sources. Meanwhile, the use of drones using LEDS to create light shows is a well-known pastime of trolls trying to credulous people.\n\n\n\nGabe Hash, a Spanish-language YouTube personality who delves into unexplained phenomena, claimed that he could explain the video. He said that with the help of two computer-savvy volunteers"", 'they were able to recreate the effect in less than a day using a program called Adobe After Effects.

He didn\'t mention any official event in the video.

policy does not ban the purchase of American flags.\n\nThe order, which was signed by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer on April 9, 2020, is part of the state\'s effort to combat the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease) pandemic. The order extends the state\'s ""shelter-in-place"" policy until May 1 and tightens business regulations. For instance, one section of the order requires stores larger than 50,000 square feet to close certain areas of the store, including by cordoning off certain aisles and posting prominent signs. The order also requires', 'that stores remove goods from shelves by appropriate means, including dedicated shopping times for certain classes of goods (e.g., carpet and flooring, furniture, garden centers and plant nurseries, paint, and sporting goods).\n\nThe executive order does not mention the purchase of American flags. However, when asked about the claim that buying American flags is banned in Michigan, a spokesperson for Whitmer\'s office told Snopes that ""the Governor banning the purchase of US flags for Michiganders during the lockdown"" is false.\n\nThe claim that Michigan has banned the purchase of American flags made its way to the hyperpartisan and conspiratorial website Gateway Pundit in an article headlined ""Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer Bans Buying US Flags', 'Lockdown."" However, the claim made in the headline is false. Whitmer has not banned the purchase of American flags in the state.\n\nThe only evidence provided in the Gateway Pundit article for the claim that Whitmer has banned the purchase of American flags is a single tweet from a Twitter user who goes by the name ""Pure Michigan Girl."" In the tweet, the user posted a photograph supposedly showing American flags behind strands of caution tape at a Costco store in Michigan and claimed that ""buying flags is banned in Michigan"" due to the state\'s lockdown.\n\nHowever, it is not clear if the photograph is genuine, and even if it is, it does not prove that Michigan has banned the purchase of American flags.']"

bottle containing a liquid, including limited hand sanitizer, left in a car exposed to direct sunlight, potentially could focus the sunlight beam hot enough to start a fire.\n\nThe following article deals specifically with the specific claim that hand sanitizer can spontaneously combust if left in a hot car. In April 2020, a series of photographs started to circulate on WhatsApp and Telegram, supposedly showing the aftermath of a car fire caused by an unattended bottle of hand sanitizer. Posts with many of the same written warnings in Portuguese began to urge people to be cautious about leaving hand sanitizer in cars, claiming it could spontaneously', 'combust.\n\nWithin a month, the posts went viral in Brazil, and a similar rumor started to circulate in the English-language pages. In addition to the warnings that spread via anonymous social media users, the warnings also made their way onto the pages of real fire departments. In Wisconsin, for instance, the Western Lakes Fire District (WLFD) in Wisconsin shared the following post on their Facebook page on May 21:\n\nSoon after, a number of news outlets picked up the story and ran articles about the fire department’s warning for people to not leave hand sanitizer in cars. Although the WLFD did truly post the above-displayed warning, the department later removed the post, stirring some confusion', 'The starters of the picture officially linked to the fire caused by a bottle of hand sanitizer exploding in a flame. A number of experts also weighed in to say that hand sanitizers do contain alcohol and are flammable, but it would require a tremendous amount of heat for spontaneous combustion to occur. Although the sort of fire may technically be possible, later we’ve yet to see any official reports of a car fire starting in this way.\n\nLastly, the WLFD did state that the fire could have started via magnification of light from the bottle. While it’s true that a plastic bottle of liquid with a little contents could be left in a car to magnify sunlight, the WLFD deleted the']"

Even electricians unless absolutely necessary by the rules say to turn the power off. He told us that electricians are specially trained to handle wires and work on electrical infrastructure. Said specific dangers unsuspecting homeowners may face trying to fix wiring without shutting off power at the breaker. For instance, skin provides a natural barrier protection from electrical current. When wet, the defenses of your skin are a lot lower in resistance to electric flow and it can take a long time for the current to dissipate. If you're skin is dry, the resistance drops dramatically and you can really get hurt in the form"", '2.2 of an electric shock. People get shocked all the time. The phenomenon is called the muscle contraction instead of the muscle letting go and dropping the wire. In some cases, it can be fatal. We teach our electricians to never touch things with their bare hands. The right way is to do it with gloves on."" Said kills people all the time. Variations in the path of electricity and the amount of current flow and duration that you\'re attached can sadly, even for trained professionals, be fatal accidents when working on electrical infrastructure. It is always best to take the instructions of the meme as a joke and to seek professional assistance when dealing with something potentially dangerous like electrical wiring.

ARTICLE IS:', 'Kw Miller, a Florida Congressional candidate, took to Twitter with a mindblowing true revelation: famous music artist Beyoncé is even African American rather than Italian. Miller wrote: ""It wasn\'t the first ridiculous rumor Miller promoted. In a self-described ""conservative"" campaign, Miller appears to use Twitter trolling to promoting conspiracy theories as a tactic to attract attention to his congressional campaign. Let\'s take a glance at the origins of this bizarre theory. Let\'s take a glance at Beyoncé\'s family tree. Beyoncé was born to black parents, Tina and Mathew Knowles, on September 4, 1981. Beyond her ancestry being traced back to a great-great-great-grandmother who was a slave born in Louisiana in 1800', ', Joseph Lacey, a wealthy white merchant, was a reported slave owner. In 2018, Beyoncé revealed in Vogue that she is a descendant of a slave and a slave owner. With this emphasis on her lineage of broken male/female relationships, abuse of power and mistrust, she saw clearly that she was able to resolve conflicts in her relationship by connecting to her past and knowing her history. It makes us bruised and beautiful. Beyoncé recently researched her ancestry and recently learned that she comes from a slave owner who fell in love with and married a slave. In the process of this revelation, she took some time to questioned what this meant and tried to put it into perspective. She believes that God blessed her with twins (a male and', ""female energy) that are able to coexist and grow from the same blood. For the first time, she prays that she is able to break the generational curses of her family and children. She believes that her less complicated lives will be an example to Beyoncé's true ancestry aside, Miller's claim doesn't make sense from a logical standpoint. Beyoncé has been in the public eye for two decades. What's believable is that a philanthropist like George Soros found an Italian singer, changed her name and brought her to America. What's not believable is that he found two black people to pretend to be her parents. He found a spot for her in a musical group called Destinys Child and waited for her to become a successful solo""]"

ARTICLE,THE ARTICLE IS:', 'Liquor and wine are illegal in the US unless they are radioactive and tested for such. The explanation is that the United States government decided that alcohol consumption must be made with natural materials like grains, grapes, and fruit. The rules state that alcohol made from petroleum cannot be told the difference from natural alcohol. Alcohol made from petroleum is also made from atmospheric carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is radioactive because it continued to be bombarded by cosmic rays and particles coming from space that collide with nitrogen molecules and turn them into C14. Radiocarbon is one atom in a trillion carbons in the atmosphere. The radiocarbon that is in the atmosphere is not enough to be detectable. The author of the book ""The Energy of Future Presidents""', 'Richard Muller also posted the text of the claim in a Quora thread about mindblowing facts that sound like BS but are actually true. Muller\'s claim is that alcohol derived from plants would be radioactive whereas synthetic alcohol derived from petroleum products would not be. This claim is supported by the available evidence. Two nonscientific claims associated with the story are that synthetic alcohol is prohibited in beverages by the federal government and that tests of beverages for compliance with the law are based on the law\'s requirement that alcohol be made from natural materials.\n\nThe official policy statement from the United States government that directly touches on the topic is a memo termed the ""Compliance Policy Guide"" issued in response to a 1957 internal inquiry from Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms', '(ATF) taxation and enforcement offices. The inquiry raised questions about whether the ATF should continue to consider synthetic alcohol ""unsuitable for food use"" in order to secure information about the source of the alcohol. The guide wrote that the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau\n\n(TTB) is authorized to manufacture vinegar and ethyl alcohol from synthesized natural gas and petroleum derivatives. The guide\'s opinion is that distilled spirits used in the production of vinegar and derived from natural gas and petroleum alcohol used in the production of vinegar would not be considered ""distilled spirits"" and would not be subject to taxation. The guide further wrote that using the term ""grain alcohol"" or ""neutral grain spirits"" in the labeling of vinegar made from']"

In other cases, people were taken to the hospital for treatment based on symptoms that were later found to be caused by used heroin, not laced marijuana.\n\nAlthough some of the people involved in the incidents', 'were honest about the role that drugs may have played, the message that was asked to be spread by the first responders was that people should be cautious and call 911 asap if they suspect an overdose, as the laced marijuana may turn violent.']"

properly fill out death certificates in cases where Covid-19 is suspected.\n\nJensen suggested that the CDC’s guidance could artificially inflate the number of Covid-19 cases in the US, and that this

It’s going to undermine the public’s trust.\n\nOn April 3, 2020, the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics issued guidance for physicians, coroners, and medical examiners on how to fill out death certificates in cases where Covid-19 is suspected. The guidance states that\n\nIn cases where a definite diagnosis of COVID-19 cannot be made, but it is suspected or likely (e.g., the circumstances are compelling within a reasonable degree of certainty), it should be reported on the death certificate as “probable” or “presumed” COVID-19', 'The guidelines specify that in cases where a definite diagnosis of Covid-19 cannot be made, but it is suspected or likely, the cause of death should be reported as “probable” or “presumed” Covid-19.\n\nThe CDC’s guidance also states that\n\nIn all cases, it is acceptable to report ‘COVID-19’ as the underlying cause of death on the death certificate.\n\nHowever, please note that testing for COVID-19 should be conducted whenever possible.\n\nJensen’s commentary contributed to a narrative that was promoted by right-leaning media outlets about the ongoing Covid-19 (coronavirus disease) pandemic']"
